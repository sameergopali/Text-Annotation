## Features

- üè∑Ô∏è **Text Span Annotation**: Annotate conversations into heirarchical custom-defined categories such as clinical instruction, patient concern, medication inquiry, and more.

- üìä **Customizable Labels**: Define and manage custom annotation schemas for specific research use cases.
- üß† **Export Data**: Outputs datasets in JSON format which includes text, labels and span start and end offset, for fine-tuning or prompting LLMs.


## To run
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
